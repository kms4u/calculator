## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I'd focus on css-grid, as it's a pretty useful thing that I haven't used much in my projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - This helped me for css reason.
